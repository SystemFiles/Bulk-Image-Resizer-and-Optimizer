# Bulk Image Resizer/Optimizer
I started this project when I was working on a website for a company I was working for, and I realized that I had to downscale images in order to improve load time. When I tried to do this, I realized that it took forever because I had to open each of the 10-20 images into photoshop and resize them to the same dimentions. With this program that I made, I found I was able to easily import hundreds of images (if was necessary) and resize them all in a matter of seconds rather than hours...

# Install
  - Download via cloning or via the Releases.
  - Move to its own directory
  
# How to use
  1. When ready, make sure to copy all files you would like to resize to the same directory as the Python File (For ease of use).
  2. If you have a lot of images to resize, populate a text file with all the direct paths to every image.
    a) If you have a lot. Instead of writing them, highlight and drag all the filex to your paths text file and your OS will automatically write all the direct paths for you.
    b) When this is done. Simply run the program and type in the path to your paths text file and let the program do the work for you!
  3. If you only have a few images you can add the paths while you execute the program.
    a) Simply enter the path of the image directly without quatations.
    b) Keep saying 'Y' everytime to continue adding images.
    c) When you're done follow the instructions for the rest of the program to complete resizing/optimizing.
  4. DONE!
