# Bulk-Image-Resizer-and-Optimizer
I started this project when I was working on a website for a company I was working for, and I realized that I had to downscale images in order to improve load time. When I tried to do this, I realized that it took forever because I had to open each of the 10-20 images into photoshop and resize them to the same dimentions. With this program that I made, I found I was able to easily import hundreds of images (if was necessary) and resize them all in a matter of seconds rather than hours...
